Objective: Compare two protein's Protein Data Base X-Ray crystalography files, and determine their root means squared difference using lambda max, an F matrix, and determine how different the two are. The "Code outline" file highlights step by step process.

Outcome: Successfull. Run the main.py through the pycharm IDE, and it will work. Uses biopython packages, and can be adapted to a machine learning pipeline.
