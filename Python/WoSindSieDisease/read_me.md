Do not run, it is unfinished.

___Research Question___: Since the brain anatomy between those who can learn, focus, and remember easily vs those who have difficulty, is it possible to find the significant differences in their transcriptome? When I learn, how much is of the process can be attributed to a transcriptomic network?

___Key elements___: Genes, Region Function, Learning malfunction

___Purpose___: To generate multi-feature nodal disease network, that enrich connections between anatomical brain regions and gene expression level, based on region function, transcriptome, and disease. It was to be a pathological model of how genetic's could influence cognitive function. After completion, neuronal signal processing would be added as a key feature.

___Sources___: All data was collected from the publicly accessible Allen Brain Atlas online database. No financial resources were used for this project

___Research___: All background research on diseases, genetics, project design, and writing is saved in a seperate folder.

___Language___: The variables, classes, prompts, and functions are written in German, but the python language itself is still english.
