A collection of all my python files from classes. All was written by me, group project mates, or in the case of ECS 032A the final was written by the professor.
ECS 032A was written without an IDE, as the class did not teach what an IDE was or require it.
Some files are Jupyter notebook, require packages like SciKit Leanr, TensorFlow, ect, which can be seen at the top of each script or your IDE will tell you.
