% This lab includes a number of questions with answers that require yes/no
% as well as some explanation. In particular, several questions (Q2,Q3) ask
% if a computation "agrees" with a prior probability calculation while
% (Q5,Q8,Q10,Q11) all require some further explanations. Please respond to
% these questions with comments under the appropriate question in addition
% to doing the required numerical calculations.

% part1 Consider the possible outcomes of the following scenario. You have
% two jars â€“ one jar contains 2 red balls and 3 green balls, and the other
% jar contains 2 red balls and 2 green balls. One ball from Jar 1 is
% selected at random and moved to Jar 2, but its color is not known. One
% ball from Jar 2 is then selected at random.

% % Q1:What is the probability of a red ball having been transferred from
% Jar 1 to Jar 2 if the color of the ball drawn from Jar 2 is red?
